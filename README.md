# Netflix Movie Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Netflix movie data to explore trends in movie durations over the years. The data spans from 2011 to 2020 and includes the average movie durations for each year. The project demonstrates how to load data into a Python dictionary, convert it into a pandas DataFrame, and perform basic data analysis using Python.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the steps, code, and analysis performed on the Netflix movie data.
  
- **data/**: (Optional) Directory to store any CSV or data files used or generated during the project.
  
- **images/**: (Optional) Directory to store any images or plots generated during the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas library

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas jupyter
```

### Running the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-data-analysis.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd netflix-data-analysis
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface and run the cells to see the analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Loading Data**: The project begins by loading the provided average movie duration data into a Python dictionary.
  
2. **Data Manipulation**: The data is then converted into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
  
3. **Analysis**: The project performs basic analysis, such as calculating the average movie duration across different years, identifying trends, and visualizing the data.

## Results

The analysis reveals a trend in movie durations over the years, providing insights into whether the average duration of Netflix movies has been declining or not.
